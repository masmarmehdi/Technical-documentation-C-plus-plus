			<h4><u>What is C++?</u></h4>
			<li class="list">C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</li>
		  <li class="list">C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</li>
	<li class="list">C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</li>
			<li class="list">The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.</li>
				<h4><u>Why Use C++</u></h4>
<p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
C++ is fun and easy to learn!
As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa<p></section>

					<header id="header">Your First program in C++</header>
					<p>As we all know the first program that everyone write or we saw ,so to speak, is printing hello world to the user . It's written like this :</p>
<pre>


	#include<<code>iostream></code>
	int main()
	{
		cout<<"Hello World!\n";
		return 0;
	}
					</pre></section>

		<h4><u>C++ Variables</u></h4>
		<p>Variables are containers for storing data values.
In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="variables-list">int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
			<li class="variables-list">double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
			<li class="variables-list">char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
			<li class="variables-list">string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
			<li class="variables-list">bool - stores values with two states: true or false</li>

		<h4><u>Declaring (Creating) Variables</u></h4>
			<p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
			<pre>
<code>
		type variable=value;
		</code>
		</pre>
			<h4><u>Example</u></h4>
			<p>Here's an example how to give a value to a variable and define it's type:</p>
			<pre>
			<code>
		   int myNum;
		   myNum = 15;
		   cout << myNum; // prints 15
			 </code>
			 </pre>
		<h4><u>Example of other variables</u></h4>
		<p>here's the example of all variables:</p>
		<pre>
<code>
 int myNum = 5;               // Integer 
 double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number 
 char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
 string myText = "Hello";     // String (text)
 bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)
</code>
</pre>
			</section>
		
<section class="main-section" id="User_Input">
					<header id="header">User Input</header>
	<p>You have already learned that <strong>cout</strong> is used to output (print) values. Now we will use <strong>cin</strong> to get user input.

cin is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (>>).

In the following example, the user can input a number, which is stored in the variable x. Then we print the value of x:</p>
	<pre>
<code>
 int x; 
 cout << "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter
 cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard
 cout << "Your number is: " << x; // Display the input value
</code>
</pre>
</section>
		<section class="main-section" id="Functions_in_C++">
			<header id="header">Functions in C++</header>
			<p>A function is a <u><strong> block of code which only runs when it is called.</strong></u></p>
			<p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</p>
<p>Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p>
			<h4><u>Create a Function</u></h4>
			<p>C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can also create your own functions to perform certain actions.</p>
<p>To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses ():</p>
			<pre>
<code>
 void myFunction() 
  {
  // code to be executed
  }
</code>
</pre>
			<h4><u>Call a Function</u></h4>
			<p>Declared functions are not executed <strong>immediately</strong>. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are called.</p>
<p>To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;</p>
<p>In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:</p>
			<p>Here's an example to understand better</p>
			<pre>
<code>
  // Create a function
  void myFunction() {
  cout << "I just got executed!";
  }

  int main() {
  myFunction(); // call the function
  return 0;
  }

  // Outputs "I just got executed!"
</code>
